title: Questions which may or may not be coherent
permalink: questions

These are questions I don't want to ask because I'm not sure if they make sense, but I still want answered. 


As biotech advances, will medicine reach the point that disease is meaningless, or biological warfare advance to the point that disease is unstoppable? 

Physics is reversible, and information is never lost. But, for an entity within a physical system, information becomes practically unrecoverable. Once information is mixed in a closed system, is there a physical bound on how much information an entity within the system actually can recover? Or maybe an overall entropy cost of N bits to recover 1 bit of information mixed t time in the past? 

In really basic quantum physics, momentum and position are equivalent, but orthogonal in all the equations. In the classical physics limit though, we have positional particles that transfer momentum when they have similar position (they're close to each other), but there's no analogous momentum particles that transfer position when they have similar momentum. Where in physics does momentum become fundamentally different from position?
